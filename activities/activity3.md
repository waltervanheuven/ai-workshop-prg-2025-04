# Activity 3: Next-token prediction

In this activity you run a Python script that uses [gpt2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) to generate next token predictions and entropy and surprisal values for words in sentences.

The script as well as instructions how to install and use it can be found at [https://github.com/waltervanheuven/next-token](https://github.com/waltervanheuven/next-token).

Try different sentences to see how predictions, entropy and surprisal values change.
